# Smart Connected Worker (SCW) - Version 1.0

## Step 1: Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/BrandonBian/SCW-V1.0.git
cd SCW-V1.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Download Pre-trained Weights

```
# Create a directory named 'weights' in the SCW-V1.0 root directory.
# Not sure if this wget from google drive works. If it doesn't, follow the altenative steps to download.
cd weights
wget https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrfeUAppVzBK4A6DT92UttHZoljDv3Ft/view?usp=sharing
wget https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPHybaMrCO0iIz_4RAL44vn4iVxdK1xC/view?usp=sharing
wget https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nn9LtvmkGrpOyMc9r9ZJYiJu6JEbwGB9/view?usp=sharing
```
Or, you can just download the following weights from my goolge drive and copy them into a "weights" directory:
1. [yolov3_journal.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrfeUAppVzBK4A6DT92UttHZoljDv3Ft/view?usp=sharing): the pre-trained weight for performing real-time YOLO-based object detection of the printer interior camera.
2. [craft_mlt_25k.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPHybaMrCO0iIz_4RAL44vn4iVxdK1xC/view?usp=sharing): for performing the CRAFT-based text-detection module.
3. [TPS-ResNet-BiLSTM-Attn.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nn9LtvmkGrpOyMc9r9ZJYiJu6JEbwGB9/view?usp=sharing): Similarly, for performing the CRAFT-based text-detection module.

## Step 3: Configuration for Smart Meter Connection (Modbus)
